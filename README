## Introduction
The **Aviation Risk Analysis Project** focuses on analyzing historical aviation data to identify trends, assess risks, and provide actionable recommendations for improving aviation safety. This analysis is intended to assist aviation companies in making data-driven decisions about aircraft purchases, safety protocols, and risk management.

## Project Goals
1. Identify aircraft with the lowest risk scores based on historical data.
2. Analyze the relationship between injury severity, purpose of flight, and aircraft damage.
3. Highlight trends in aviation safety over time.
4. Provide actionable insights to improve safety and operational efficiency.

## Dataset Description
- **Source**: Historical aviation accident data.
- **Key Columns**:
  - `Make`: Manufacturer of the aircraft.
  - `Injury.Severity`: Severity of injuries (e.g., Fatal, Non-Fatal, Serious).
  - `Total.Fatal.Injuries`: Number of fatalities per incident.
  - `Purpose.of.flight`: Purpose of the flight (e.g., Business, Personal).
  - `Aircraft.damage`: Extent of damage to the aircraft.
  - `Risk.Score`: A calculated metric to assess safety and risk.
- **Size**: Approximately 88,000 rows.

## Analysis and Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns.
   - Standardized inconsistent data (e.g., aircraft makes with multiple spellings).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Assessed trends in injuries, accidents, and operational conditions.
   - Created visualizations for better understanding.
3. **Risk Score Calculation**:
   - Assigned numerical values to injury severity (Fatal = 3, Serious = 2, Non-Fatal = 1).
   - Weighted scores to evaluate risks for aircraft makes and purposes of flight.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Generated heatmaps, bar plots, and scatter plots to identify patterns.

## Key Findings
1. **Low-Risk Aircraft**:
   - Aircraft from manufacturers like Boeing consistently demonstrate lower fatality rates.
2. **High-Risk Factors**:
   - Personal flights show a higher frequency of fatal accidents compared to business or commercial flights.
3. **Impact of Weather**:
   - Adverse weather significantly increases accident severity.
4. **Time-Based Trends**:
   - Accidents have decreased over the last decade due to improved safety protocols.
5. **Aircraft Damage**:
   - Substantial damage often correlates with non-fatal injuries, while destroyed aircraft lead to higher fatality rates.

## Recommendations
1. **Focus on Low-Risk Aircraft**:
   - Prioritize Boeing models for their reliability and safety.
2. **Improve Safety Training**:
   - Ensure pilots operating personal flights receive additional safety training.
3. **Leverage Technology**:
   - Invest in aircraft with advanced safety features for better accident prevention.
4. **Monitor Weather Conditions**:
   - Avoid flights under adverse weather conditions, particularly for smaller aircraft.
